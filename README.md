# Trex-Chrome-Bot
We applied Reinforcement Learning (Deep Q Learning (DQN)) to train a model to identify the obstacles in the Trex game in Chrome and avoid them. We compared the performance of the bot by giving hand-made features given to DQN and automatic feature extraction using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
